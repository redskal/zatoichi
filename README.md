###### _Retrieve Cisco running-config through SNMP brute forcing_

Pretty much untested and the code is incredibly messy.

Zatoichi started out its life as 'snmpbrute' by Aidan O'Kelly. My modifications are:
* Target Cisco router config's specifically
* Spoof source address and port

I'm currently looking to port this across to Python so it's here as more of an exhibition piece.
